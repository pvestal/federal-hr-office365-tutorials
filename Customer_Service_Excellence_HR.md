**E** - Ensure follow-through

### Common HR Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: The Policy Enforcer Dilemma

### Setting Boundaries with Grace

Instead of: "That's not my job"
Say: "Jennifer in Benefits specializes in this. Let me connect you 
directly - I'll walk you over/warm transfer you."

Instead of: "I don't know"
Say: "That's a great question. Let me find that information for 
you. I'll have an answer by [specific time]."

Instead of: "You'll have to wait"
Say: "I can help you with this. It typically takes [timeframe]. 
Is that timeline workable for you?"
